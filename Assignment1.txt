1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

Solution:-

*       -- Expression

'hello' -- Value

-87.8   --Value
-       --Expression

/       --Expression

+       --Expression

6       --Value

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Solution:-

   String :
      1. This is data or piece of information.
      2. Variable is used to store this data.
      
   Variable :
      1. This is used to store a data / Information.
      2. We can define in simple words as an empty space.
      
3. Describe three different data types.

Solution :-
   Data types : Every value / data has its specific type, which is known as data types.
   Eg : Numbers , String , List , Tuple , Set , Dictionary
   
   String :
       1. A string is a sequence of characters. 
       2. It can be created simply by enclosing characters in quotes.
       3. It is immutable sequence of data
      Eg . "Kumar" , "1234" ,'K12sdf'
      
   List :
      1. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.These are created using square brackets
      2. List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
      3. List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.Lists are majorly used everywhere.
     Eg. [12,345,76.98,"Naveena",'km546']
  
  Dictionary :
      1. Here data stored as a key -value pair , where key should be unique.
      2. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
      3. Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.
      4. Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
    Eg. {'Name' : "Preethi" , "Mail_Id" : 'abcd123@ineuron.com','Salary' : 5000}
    
4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do? 

Solution:-

  Expression :
      1. Expression is a combination of operators and operands which gives a value as output.
      2. Operators refers to +,-,*,% and so on.. ,Where as operands are values.
    
    Expressions perform operations by using operators and operands, which provides value as output.
    For Example : A + B = C
           Here A,B are operand, whereas + , = are operands and C is the output.
           We can have similar examples like,
              [a*a , a+a ,a%a] , (a+b ,a**3)
              
5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

Solution:-
     
    1. An expression can be defined as any element that evaluates some values.Statements represent a motion or command e.g print statements,        mission statements. Expressions need to be evaluated.
    2. An expression is any series of symbols that represents a value. For example, 2.9, a + 5, (3 + 5) / 4.
    3. Instructions are something that an interpreter can execute are known as statements.

  Example : Print("This is completely new") --- Statement
            Spam = 10 --- It's a statement because it has nothing to give as output.
            
6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

Solution :
   bacon = 22
   
7. What should the values of the following two terms be?

'spam' + 'spamspam' --- 'spamspamspam'
'spam' * 3          --- 'spamspamspam'

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Solution:
   There are rules for naming a variable .One of the rule includes that , a variable name cannot start with Number.That's why 100 is invalid where as eggs is valid variable.
   
9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

Solution:-
    The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.
    
10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
      'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos'
      
Solution :-
    The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings with the + operator.
    The correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos'.
