1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?

Sol .
    When we need to code, making functions is important since it allows us to make our code reusable and reduce the number of times we need to produce the same thing. As a result, we can only create one and then use it as needed. Based on coding and math, the function is simple to read and comprehend and is straightforward to test.
    
2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?

Sol.
   Code in a function runs when it's called.

3. What statement creates a function?

sol.
   The def keyword followed by function name with ()and : , creates a function.The statements in the block must be indented.
  Eg.  def test():
             ------statement---

4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?

sol.
   Function is a block of code,that does a particular operation and gives output.It may or maynot have parameters.
   Function call is a code, which used to pass control to function.

5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?

Sol.
   There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.
   
6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
Sol.
   The local variable can be used outside the function any time after the function call completes.

7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?

Sol. 
   Concept of return value is very simple, as it returns the output after completion of task.
   Yes, it is possible to have a return value in an expression.
   
 Eg. def add(x,y):
         return x+y   //This code will take input parameters and provides output

8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
   
Sol.
   If a function doesn't have return statement , Then it returns NONE.
   
9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?

Sol.
   To make a function variable referring to the global variable, we need to use global keyword.
 Eg. global x
 
10. What is the data type of None?
Sol . None is of NoneType.Only None can be of it's own NoneType.

11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?

Sol.
   That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.
   
12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?

Sol. 
   This function can be called using, spam.bacon()

13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?

Sol.
   By placing the lines of code , that might give error in a try clause. 
   
14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?

sol.
   The code that could cause an error goes in the try clause.
   The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.
