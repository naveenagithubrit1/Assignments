1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

      1. A variable of the primitive data type boolean can have two values: true and false.
      2. Boolean expressions use relational and logical operators. The result of a Boolean expression is either true or false.
    Eg. : if A > B: True
          else : False
          
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?                     
   
   The three basic boolean operators are: AND, OR, and NOT.
   
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

  AND :                            OR :                           NOT :
        A     B    O/P                 A    B    O/p                  A   O/p
        
        1     1     1                  1    1     1                   1    0
        1     0     0                  1    0     1                   0    1
        0     1     0                  0    1     1
        0     0     0                  0    0     0
        
4. What are the values of the following expressions?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)    ---- False  
not (5 > 4)             ---- False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)     ---- True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))--- False
(True and True) and (True == False) ----- False
(not False) or (not True) ----- True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
  
  Comparison Operators :
      < , > , == , != , >= , <=
      
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

Solution:
  Equal Operator is '==', This compares two values of its right and left hand sides.
   Eg : 5 == 3 , A == B , 4/2 == 10/5
  Assignment Operator is '=' , which assigns the value to the variable.
   Eg : A = 15 , Name = "Kranthi"

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Solution :
 Three blocks in the code is :
  Block 1 :  print('eggs')
      if spam > 5:
       print('bacon')
     else:
       print('ham')
   print('spam')
  
  Block 2 : print('bacon')
  
  Block 3 : print('ham')
  
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

    spam = int(input())
    if spam == 1:
        print("Hello")
    elif spam == 2:
        print("Howdy")
    else:
        print("Greetings!")
        
9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

     By pressing  Ctrl + C , we can come out of an endless loop.
     
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
  
    Break :- This terminates the remaining iterations.
    Continue :- It skips the iteration and other iterations will be done without any interruptions.
    
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

    In a for loop :
       range(10) = it gives 0 to 9
       range(0,10) = It gives 0 to 9
       range(0,10,1) = It also gives 0 to 9
       
    Clearly there no difference exists.
    
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Using For Loop :

        For i in range(1,11):
            print(i)
            
Using While Loop :

       while i in range(1,11):
            print(i)
            
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?

Solution:
     
        spam.bacon()
